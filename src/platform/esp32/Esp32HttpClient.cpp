// Exactly ONE TLS session exists on this device, and it belongs to the API.
//
// Artwork used to have its own. It cannot: an established mbedTLS session
// allocates a ~16.7KB input buffer and a ~16.7KB output buffer, each of which
// must be CONTIGUOUS, and this board simply does not keep a 34KB run of heap
// free once WiFi, the view sprites and the JPEG decoder have taken their share.
//
// The measurements, all taken mid-failure on hardware:
//
//   free 81712, largest block 19444  -> handshake fails, two sessions live
//   free 122348, largest block 32756 -> handshake STILL fails, one session live
//
// That second line is the important one. Dropping the API session first was not
// enough: 32756 fits the first 16.7KB buffer and leaves ~16KB, just short of the
// second. The requirement sits right on the boundary, so it failed whenever the
// active view happened to hold one sprite too many — which is why the cover came
// and went with no pattern anyone could see from the outside.
//
// So artwork is fetched over plain HTTP and needs no session at all. The bytes
// are public cover images; nothing here is secret, no token or client secret
// goes near the CDN, and the API keeps full certificate validation. The upside
// beyond reliability is speed: a download that cost 1.3-4.5s of handshake is now
// a few hundred milliseconds.
//
// The HTTPClient and its client are owned as a PAIR, and both are heap-allocated
// so a reset can destroy them in the right order.
//
// HTTPClient keeps a raw _client pointer and never clears it — not in end(),
// not in disconnect(). Deleting the WiFiClientSecure underneath a surviving
// HTTPClient therefore leaves that pointer dangling, and the next request
// crashes inside HTTPClient::connected() (LoadProhibited, EXCVADDR 0x18) called
// from setTimeout(), which runs BEFORE begin() gets a chance to rebind it. The
// crash lands a poll later than the mistake, in code that looks innocent.
//
// This was already latent on the transport-error path; making the artwork
// download reset the API session turned "rare" into "every album change".
